# Web Design

## Exercises

### Excersice 1 - Monday

During this excersise we had to focus on the following points in our newly designed accessible tools:

* Study Situation
* Ignore Conventions
* Prioritise Identity
* Add Nonsense

These all fall under the *Exclusive Design Principles*.

I received the excersise of Marijn, who uses his keyboard for everything on the web.

I choose to take a shot at the **datepicker**.
