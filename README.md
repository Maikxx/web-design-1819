## Exercises

### Exercises Week 1

During this excersise we had to focus on the following points in our newly designed accessible tools:

* Study Situation
* Ignore Conventions
* Prioritise Identity
* Add Nonsense

These all fall under the *Exclusive Design Principles*.

I received the excersise of Marijn, who uses his keyboard for everything on the web.

I choose to take a shot at the **date picker**.

When researching accessible date pickers, I found that it is a pretty known theme in the community.
Despite being pretty known in the community, several large Dutch websites have varying implementations of the date picker:

* [NS](https://www.ns.nl) for example has a very decent and accessible date picker for choosing a departure date.

    In this date picker you can navigate the dates with the arrow keys, also enabling the user to navigate multiple months by just pressing the down key.

    The only negative things I can find about this implementation is that you can not target the 'switch months' buttons at the top of the date picker with the tab keys.

    ![NS Example](./docs/ns_example.png)

* [9292](https://www.9292.nl). This date picker is very similar to the date picker from the NS, with the subtle difference that you don't see in the pop-up window when you navigate beyond the current month.

    You can also not navigate to any other day in the week when navigating beyond the scope of the pop-up window.

    I consider this implementation to be very bad, since it just doesn't do everything that I would want in this functionality.

    ![9292 Example](./docs/9292_example.png)

More things that I have noticed about these date pickers, is that they are mainly built using JQuery and JQuery UI, which means they (probably) are built a pretty long time ago.

Examples of good date pickers that I have found are:

### Exercises Week 2

#### User scenario


#### Design principles

* **Clarity**: For Marijn, clarity is really important, since it releases the stress on him, preserved to him by websites with a lot of interactive elements at once. You should avoid having too much elements on any given section of the page to improve the users understanding of the interactive elements on the page. Buttons and links should also be clear from the get-go. In my project I added focus and hover states on all buttons and links to be very clear what can be interacted with.
    It should also be very clear here for the user what the date is that he has currently selected.

* **Keep users in control**: Since this product is especially created for Marijn, I wanted to give him as much options as possible within one demo application. An example I can give of this is that I gave Marijn the option to use the native date picker from the browser if he wished to use that over the custom made one.

* **Consistency matters**: This principle is relating to the fact that similar elements with similar actions (like links) should look and behave (pretty much) the same. In this application I mainly seperated the links from the buttons in styling. Buttons having a border, while links always have an underline, even if they wouldn't navigate to another page.

* **Progressive disclosure**: This principle means to not bombard a user with all the "elements" needed to complete a step, instead give the user the elements step by step to reduce cognitive load. In this project I decided it would be best for Marijn to split the date picker up in multiple sections, the year, month and day selection "screens".

## Review sessions

### Review session week 1

Marijn was unfortunately not present at this moment, which resulted in the group not knowing exactly what he can and what he can't do on the web.

We did get to know some things about him, for example:

* He uses an **Apple MacBook Pro** as his **daily driver**.
* The only **assistive technology** he uses is **sticky keys**.
* He only uses one hand to use his computer.
* Has issues lifting his hand.
* Uses his left hand.
* Is a programmer
* Can use the arrow keys.
* Can be seen as spastic.
* Is difficult to understand with his voice.

## Process

* [ ] Write a user scenario.
* [ ] Explain how the exclusive design principles will work on this demo (as well as how to test it).
* [ ] How to use Joshua Porters design principles in this excercise. (Explain how the principle works and how to implement it.)

## Project tips

* Things may fail.
* Make prototypes.
* Take a look at access keys.
* Focus on multiple small items.
* It should initially just work for the user, then be pleasurable to use.
* Multiple small tests are more effective than a few large tests.

You should not test _known knowns_, but instead test the _known uknowns_ and the _unknown unknowns_.

**Usability**: Learnable, efficient, rememberable, mistake aversion, nice to use.

If you want to get to know user needs, write a user scenario.
